  Nothing much , its just a solution for an interview question I saw it in social media ( from Microsoft I think ) .
  The problem is that we have a sequence of repeated characters ( EX: AAAABBBBBCCCCCCC ) we want to compresse it ,
while still being able to expand it back to the original one.
  My solution to this problem is using patterns, taking the number of how many times a character have being repeated
and put in the new sentence in a certaine way using '*' and '.' to organize the sequence.
check the code for more information and to understand it more.
  I made the two algorithems , the compressing and the decompressing one.
